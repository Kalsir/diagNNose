This library contains a set of modules that can be used to analyse recurrent neural networks.
In particular, it contains functionality for :
- **Extracting** activations from different types of (language) models and providing quick access to these stored activations.
- Running **diagnostic classifiers** ([Hupkes et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10203.pdf)) on extracted activations.
- Running **control tasks** ([Hewitt & Liang, 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03368.pdf)) parallel to these diagnostic classifiers.
- Performing **contextual decomposition** ([Murdoch et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05453.pdf)) on a model.
- Running a broad linguistic [**downstream task suite**](https://github.com/i-machine-think/diagnnose/tree/master/diagnnose/downstream) on a language model.

**Documentation** can be found at [diagnnose.readthedocs.io](https://diagnnose.readthedocs.io).

Our library is officially registered with pip and can be installed by running `pip install diagnnose`.
The preferred version of Python is â‰¥3.7. The required packages are stated in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/i-machine-think/diagnnose/blob/master/requirements.txt).
